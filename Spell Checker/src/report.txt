I did the extra credit and as running the main method shows,
the sorting based method is significantly slower at finding
the jumbled word. With that there is much more in involved. I have
to sort every individual string, as well as now resort the dict file
so it's in lexicographic order and can then be searched through with
indexOf. Where instead the recursive anagram has an easier task of
creating every permutation and then searching for each one. Although,
both are sufficient in what they do and at least it's not an insane
difference. Recursive took 38 ms and had 38,043 comparisons on one run and
Sorting took 2,482 ms and made 67,988,436 comparisons.
